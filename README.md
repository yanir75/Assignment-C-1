# C-basic graph

In this project we will create a graph using Adjacency matrix to represent the matrix.  
We will create three functions.

Upon receiving the letter A.  
We will receive 10x10 matrix that represents a graph.

Upon receiving the letter B and 2 numbers.  
We will return true if a path between those two vertices exist, false otherwise.

Upon receiving the letter C and 2 numbers.
We will return the weight of the shortest path.

This will be done using Floyd-Warshall algorithm.
